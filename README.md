## Irisk - A swedish layout for lazy fingers

## COMBO_ENABLE

Seemed like a good idea. Really wasn't. The problem is detecting the combo and differentiating from text. Probably doable for some characters, but not near enough for all special characters.

### The map

ESC     1   2   3   4   5               6   7   8   9   0   LEFT_WIN
TAB     X   C   Å   W   Z               F5  J   P   Ä   Q   BACK_SPACE
L_CTRL  A   T   N   R   B               Y   O   S   I   E   R_CTRL
L_SHIFT D   M   U   K   V  CAPS          Ö   G   F   H   L   R_SHIFT
         BACK_SPACE ENTER TAB      L_ALT SPACE R_SHIFT

I do like this map. But one with layers might well be better.
Is this the real me, is this a fantasy, caught in a landslide ...
